```

```

## Vercel Deployment

- Sign up or login with your GitHub account

### 2. Import your GitHub Repository
- Click "Add New..." â†’ "Project"
- Select your "restaurant-management-dashboard" repository
- Vercel will automatically detect it as a Next.js project

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
- Add the following environment variables:
  - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: A random string for NextAuth.js (keep it secure)
  - `NEXTAUTH_URL`: The URL of your deployed app (e.g., https://your-app.vercel.app)

### 4. Deploy
- Click "Deploy"
- Vercel will build and deploy your application

### 5. Update vercel.json
After deployment, update the `vercel.json` file with your actual app URL:
```json
{
  "env": {
    "NEXTAUTH_URL": "https://your-actual-url.vercel.app"
  }
}
```

## Continuous Deployment

Once set up, any changes pushed to your GitHub repository will automatically trigger a new deployment on Vercel.

## Troubleshooting

### Logo Not Displaying
- Make sure `public/logo.png` exists and is properly referenced
- Check the domains list in `next.config.js` includes all image sources

### Authentication Issues
- Verify your `.env.local` and Vercel environment variables are set correctly
- Make sure `NEXTAUTH_URL` matches your deployment URL
- Check for any middleware errors in the Vercel logs
